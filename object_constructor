OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR
==================


function Person(name,age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.species = "Homo Sapiens";
}

var sally = new Person ("Sally Bowles", 39);
var holden = new Person ("Holden Caulfield", 16);
console.log("sally's species is " + sally.species + " and she is " + sally.age );
console.log("holden's species is " + holden.species + " and he is " + holden.age );



//We use the function Person like a object constructor (this is the general Object constructor: var bob = new Object()where the
// the properties are defined for example : bob.age = 20;). 
//In this code, inside the Person function, we define one of the properties, so when we log it in the console all the persons
//we created before, the propertie SPECIES will be "Homo Sapiens"
