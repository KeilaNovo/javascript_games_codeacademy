//When we want to create a private variable, inside of Person class we declare it with "var" not with "this."

//How we access to them:

function Person(first,last,age) {
   this.firstname = first;
   this.lastname = last;
   this.age = age;
   var bankBalance = 7500;
  
   this.getBalance = function() {
      return bankBalance;
   };
}

var john = new Person('John','Smith',30);
console.log(john.bankBalance);

// create a new variable that calls getBalance()
var myBalance = john.getBalance();
console.log(myBalance);

//We still obtain in the first print "undefined", but in the second one, we will have printed the information we need.
